Outfile -> out_wo_bonf.kmerDiff



The evec2pca.perl program is for users who want to run the EIGENSTRAT
stratification correction method on on output produced by the smartpca program.


example.evec is file of principal components produced by smartpca
example.ind is individual file
example.pca is file of principal components in file needed by eigenstrat


  smartpca: run Principal Components Analysis on input genotype data.
  ploteig: construct plot of top 2 principal components
  twstats: compute number of statistically significant principal components.
  evec2pca.perl: convert eigenvector file to format needed for EIGENSTRAT  
  smartrel: identify related samples, accounting for population structure


total_kmer_counts.txt :- Total number of kmers in each sample 
gwas_eigenstratX.ind :- 0, 1 -> case, control 
out_wo_bonf_sorted.kmerDiff:-> kmer kmer_p_val cnt_in_samples 
gwas_eigenstrat.pca -> top 10 pca and samples new coordinates under these pca
